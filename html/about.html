      <h2 class="about">
        I am a Full-Stack/Frontend developer based in Buffalo NY. I am
        interested in interactive design, user experience and new technologies.
        I like art, music, and martial arts. Graduating with a general
        engineering in software engineering gives me a great understanding of
        many different science and math subjects retaining to software. To round
        myself out even more, I also have a minor in pre-law and have skills in
        visual arts, such as drawing, film, and graphic design.
